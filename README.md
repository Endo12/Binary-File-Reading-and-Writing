# Binary-File-Reading-and-Writing
Uses the BufferedReader and BufferedWriter to read from and write to a binary file.
Specifically, Assignment 6A (the reader program) reads raw data from PovertyData.txt and writes relevant data to the binary file OrganizedPovertyData.dat. Assignment 6B (the writer program) reads that binary file and then writes it to the text file Report.txt. 
The 2 programs make use of a custom Data class that can create Data objects that are easily made to hold the relevant data.
